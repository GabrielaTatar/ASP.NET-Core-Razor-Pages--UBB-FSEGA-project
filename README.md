# ASP.NET-Core-Razor-Pages--UBB-FSEGA-project

I created an ASP.NET Core Web App type project, where we have an application for a library.There were several branches created, each containing another functionality. In the project, I used the Razor Identity class library to create the authentication. Moreover, the created application is the online version for a library, where we have borrowed books, authors, publications,Â etc.
